 This branch Indus_Master has been created to commit all the changes of the MODBUS-Wifi-BLE bridge
project. If there are any releases, then we will create another branch based on this and use that
to track a specific customer or release.

 The naming convention for a specific customer release in that case should be as follows.

 Indus_<Customer-Name>_Rel_<major>_<minor>_<release>

 For example, for Delta, this will be something like

 Indus_Delta_Rel_1_0_1
